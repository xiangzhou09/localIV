Description: In the generalized Roy model, the marginal treatment effect (MTE) can be used as
  a building block for constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average treatment
  effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil 2006
  <doi:10.1162/rest.88.3.389>). Given a treatment selection model and an outcome model, the function mte()
  estimates the MTE via local instrumental variables (or via a normal selection model) and also the
  projection of MTE onto the 2-dimensional space of the propensity score and a latent variable representing
  unobserved resistance to treatment (Zhou and Xie 2018 <https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/xzhou/files/zhou-xie_mte2.pdf>).
  The object returned by mte() can be used to estimate conventional parameters such as ATE and ATT
  (via average()) or marginal policy-relevant treatment effects (via mprte()).
