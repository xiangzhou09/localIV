Description: In the generalized Roy model, the marginal treatment effect (MTE) can be used as
  a building block for constructing conventional causal parameters such as the average treatment
  effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil 2006
  <doi:10.1162/rest.88.3.389>). Given a treatment selection model and an outcome model, the function mte()
  estimates the MTE via a semiparametric local instrumental variables method (or via a normal selection model).
  The function eval_mte() evaluates MTE at any combination of covariates x and latent resistance u, and the
  function eval_mte_tilde() evaluates MTE projected onto the estimated propensity score (Zhou and Xie 2019
  <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/702172>). The object returned by mte() can be used to
  estimate conventional parameters such as ATE, ATT, and ATU (via average()) or marginal policy-relevant
  treatment effects (via mprte()).
